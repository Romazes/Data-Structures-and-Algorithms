 The timing tests are run for array sizes of 100 elements, 1,000 elements, and 10,000 elements.
 
 1.000 elements:
                -Selection Sort: 40.0576 --- 1
                -Bubble sort:    500.72
                -Insertion sort: 871.2528
 
 10.000 elements:
                -Selection Sort: 2864.1184 --- 1
                -Bubble sort:    53607.0832
                -Insertion sort: 84751.8672

 All of these algorithms are fairly easy to implement and they all work well with small data sets
